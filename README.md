## Reflection

The idea was inspired by FreeCodeCamp's curriculum to make a simple JS WikiPedia search engine, but I decided to use Node.js to practice my knowledge of running applications on a host server, as well as familiarize myself with making HTTP requests in Node.js to dynamically influence the UI.

Right now, the app only searches for matching/similar titles, but could be expanded to include the content of WikiPedia articles. Another additional functionality would be to save all searches or save the time of a search to a database for statistics on the use of the application.
